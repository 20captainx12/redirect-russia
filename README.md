# Redirect Russia

One line of code to **redirect Russian traffic** from your site to support Ukraine:

```html
<script src="https://redirectrussia.org/v1.js" async></script>
```

[**Visit Redirect Russia** for more info and advanced configuration â†’](https://redirectrussia.org)

## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ How it works

When someone from Russia visits your website, they'll be redirected to a page that looks [like this](https://redirectrussia.org/?from=example.com). They can find information about how they can help Ukraine.
